Folding a towel might seem simple, but for a robot it means solving perception, planning, and dexterous manipulation all at once, especially when dealing with soft, deformable fabric. We walk through how the system sees the towel, identifies key features, and executes each fold autonomously. \n\nThis demo is part of our work on embodied AI and physical intelligence.

      "description": "Most enterprise knowledge is trapped in meetings—and then lost forever. Otter.ai CEO Sam Liang explains how his company turned meeting transcription into a $100M+ revenue business by solving a problem most companies don't even realize they have.\n\nIn this episode, we cover:\n\n- Why meetings are your company's most expensive activity (and how to measure ROI on them)\n- Building a \"meeting-centric knowledge base\" that captures voice data other systems miss\n- How Otter organizes enterprise knowledge like Slack—but for spoken conversations\n- Real-time sales coaching that feeds reps answers during customer calls\n- AI avatars that attend meetings on your behalf (and ask questions for you)\n- The technical challenges of understanding dialects, tone, and context in voice AI\n- How one financial company used Otter to onboard new clients instantly with full conversation history\n- Privacy vs. utility: designing permission systems for meeting data\n- The future of active AI agents that contribute to meetings, not just transcribe them\n\nSam previously worked on the blue dot location platform for Google Maps and now runs a company that's transcribed over 1 billion meetings. If you're thinking about how AI can actually improve enterprise workflows (not just automate busywork), this conversation is packed with specific, tactical insights.\n\nA special thank you to this episode's sponsor, SAS: https://www.sas.com/en/whitepapers/how-aiot-is-reshaping-industrial-efficiency-security-and-decision-making.html?utm_source=other&utm_medium=cpm&utm_campaign=-global\n\nResources mentioned:\n• Otter.ai $100M ARR announcement: https://otter.ai/blog/otter-ai-breaks-100m-arr-barrier-and-transforms-business-meetings-launching-industry-first-ai-meeting-agent-suite\n• HIPAA compliance: https://otter.ai/blog/otter-ai-achieves-hipaa-compliance\n• Otter.ai: https://otter.ai\n\nSubscribe to The Neuron newsletter: https://theneuron.ai\n\n➤ CHAPTERS\n0:00 - Introduction & Sam's Background\n1:16 - From Meeting Notes to Enterprise Knowledge\n04:48 - Building a Meeting-Centric Knowledge Base\n06:14 - Why Meetings Are Your Most Expensive Activity\n05:40 - Solving Information Silos with AI\n07:56 - A Message from our Sponsor SAS\n9:11 - Meeting Transcriptions Alone Aren't the Answer\n17:34 - Leader Dashboards & AI Workflows\n18:49 - AI Avatars: Send Your Digital Self to Meetings\n21:45 - Active AI Agents That Talk Back\n23:13 - Privacy, Permissions & Corporate Culture\n26:08 - Technical Challenges: Understanding Context & Tone\n34:37 - Privacy vs. Utility Trade-offs\n37:25 - The Future of Meetings in 2027\n39:27 - Competing with Microsoft & Google\n43:02 - How Otter Generated Over $1 Billion in Customer ROI\n46:05 - What Excites & Concerns Sam About AI\n49:09 - Security Risks of AI Avatars\n49:50 - Final Thoughts on the Future of AI at Work\n\nHosted by: Corey Noles and Grant Harvey\nGuest: Sam Liang, Co-founder & CEO, Otter.ai\nPublished by: Manique Santos\nEdited by: Kush Felisilda",

      "description": "Google just dropped Gemini 3 Flash—a model that outperforms Gemini 2.5 Pro (their last top model) while running 3x faster at less than 1/4 the cost. It's frontier-level reasoning at Flash-level speed, and it's rolling out globally right now.\n\nTomorrow, we're sitting down with Logan Kilpatrick from Google DeepMind to explore what this actually means for developers, knowledge workers, and anyone trying to figure out how AI fits into their workflow.\n\nWhat we'll cover:\n\n🔥 Live demos – Logan will show us Gemini 3 Flash in action, from coding to multimodal understanding \n\n⚡ What's now possible – Use cases that weren't practical with previous models (or weren't possible at all)\n\n🛠️ Building together – We might wire up a tool live if Logan's game (we've got ideas) \n\n💰 Intelligence too cheap to meter – We'll dig into the economics: when AI gets this powerful and this affordable, does it change the hiring calculus? \n\nOn that last point: right now, data shows AI is raising wages for AI-impacted roles because workers who use AI effectively can command higher salaries. But what happens when frontier intelligence costs $0.50 per million tokens? When does “intelligence as a commodity” flip from “AI makes workers more valuable” to “why hire a human?” We’ll see if we can get Logan’s take on this topic! \n\nKey specs on Gemini 3 Flash:\n\nOutperforms Gemini 2.5 Pro across most benchmarks\n\n3x faster than 2.5 Pro\n\nLess than 1/4 the cost of Gemini 3 Pro\n\n1M token context window\n\nAdvanced visual and spatial reasoning with code execution\n\n78% on SWE-bench Verified (agentic coding)\n\nRolling out globally in Gemini app, AI Mode in Search, and developer platforms\n\nLogan has been at the center of Google's push to make frontier AI accessible to millions of developers. If you're shipping products, building with AI, or just trying to wrap your head around where this is all going, this conversation will give you clarity.\n\nJoin us live, ask questions in chat, or catch the replay after.",

      "description": "Watch Gemini 3 Flash handle a high-demand product launch from start to finish. Using Google Antigravity, the model updates a crochet animal shop with a new limited release and sets up an automated email waitlist to manage the hype.\n\nPrompt:  I am releasing a new crocheted bunny in a banana suit. There are a couple things I want to do. First I want to add the product to the website, but this product will not be available yet. It will be released in a week so I want to create a form where people interested in the product can enter their information to join my newsletter. Second is focusing on the header. I want to change the button on the header image from “Explore farm drop” to “Join Waitlist”. Update the header image as well as opening the same waitlist form when the header image is clicked. I attached the images and the rest of the product information can be found in this google sheet with the ID “cotton_tail”.\n\nTo learn more:\nSubscribe to Google Antigravity → http://youtube.com/@googleantigravity\nWebsite: https://antigravity.google/\nX: https://x.com/antigravity\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/google-antigravity",

Or did OpenAI push too fast? \n\n🔔 Subscribe, smash that reminder button, and join the chat with your own test ideas.

      "description": "The Men Who Measure Every AI Model\n\nIf you've ever wondered \"Is Claude actually better than GPT-4?\" or \"Should I switch to that new Chinese model?\"—tomorrow's guest has the answer.\n\nMicah Hill-Smith and George Cameron run Artificial Analysis, the independent testing lab that's basically become the Consumer Reports of AI. Their team benchmarks every major model on intelligence, speed, and price. They just dropped their State of AI Q2 2025 report showing some wild shifts in the leaderboard.\n\nHere's what we're covering:\n- Gemini 3.0, Claude Opus 4.5, and Kimi K2\n- The Kimi K2 shock: How a $4.6M Chinese model just beat GPT-5 on reasoning benchmarks (and what that means for OpenAI's moat)\n- What companies actually use: Micah sees which models Fortune 500s are really deploying vs. what they say publicly\n- The speed wars: Why some \"slower\" models are crushing it in production\n- His personal stack: What Micah uses for his own work (spoiler: it's not always the \"smartest\" model)\n- How they test: The wild process of evaluating models across 50+ benchmarks\n- Your questions: We're taking audience Q&A—reply with what you want us to ask\n\nFun fact: Micah started Artificial Analysis as a side project while at McKinsey because he couldn't find unbiased model comparisons. Now major AI labs nervously refresh his site before launches to see how they stack up.\n\n🎙️ New to streaming or looking to level up?

      "description": "Marketing in 2025 looks nothing like it did two years ago. 👀\n\nBy now, all marketers should already know how to use ChatGPT or Claude to improve our marketing copy game, or use Nano Banana Pro to make images. You might even know a bit about the AI video tools like Veo 3 or Runway and Kling that you can use to create content. 🚀 ✍️\n\nBut that's just the beginning of marketing. That's why we're bringing in four companies to show you what's actually possible right now. \n\nWe'll have four back to back live demos of tools solving real problems, from teams backed by Sequoia, Kleiner Perkins, Khosla Ventures, and others who've built platforms already used by companies like Uber, DoorDash, and Reddit. \n\nThey are: \n\n- Jonathan Gudai from AdOmni on how his Jeen AI tool is making ad buying smarter and more efficient.\n\n- Jonathan Meyers from Agentio sharing how to automate the entire creator campaign lifecycle (from matching to payment) using their platform.\n\n- Crystal Foote from DCG showing their Resonance Pathway tool that maps the fastest route between your brand and audience emotion.\n\n- James Cadwallader from Profound on the wild new frontier: marketing your products directly to AI systems like ChatGPT and Claude when they're making recommendations to users.\n\nThese are teams backed by Sequoia, Kleiner Perkins, Khosla Ventures, and other top-tier investors who've already built platforms used by Reddit, DoorDash, and leading consumer brands. If you work in marketing, you won’t wanna miss this one.\n\nJoin us this Thursday to see what the new marketing playbook looks like. ✅\n\n🎙️ New to streaming or looking to level up?

You’ll walk out feeling like an agentic-coding wizard, even if you’re starting from zero.\n\nGPT-5.1 Codex Max is OpenAI’s latest frontier agentic coding model. It’s built on an upgraded reasoning backbone and trained to handle real-world software engineering tasks end to end: PRs, refactors, frontend builds, and deep debugging. It can work independently for hours, compacting its own history so it can refactor entire projects and run multi-hour agent loops without losing context.\n\nIn this live session, we’ll set it up together, build real agents, and push Codex Max to its limits. We’ll also save plenty of time for audience Q&A.\n\n🎙️ New to streaming or looking to level up? Check out StreamYard and get $10 discount! 😍 https://streamyard.com/pal/d/5214856690925568",

      "description": "Cole Medin walks us through Anthropic's harness for long-running agents and shows what happens when you let Claude code for 24 hours straight. We built on top of the official Claude Agent SDK quickstart and added Linear for task management and observability.\n\nThe core problem this solves: agents lose all memory between context windows. The harness uses two specialized agents - an initializer that sets up the environment and creates tasks, and a coding agent that makes incremental progress while leaving clean artifacts for the next session.\n\nCole showcases a Claude.ai clone that was built entirely by this system running autonomously.\n\nRepo: https://github.com/coleam00/Linear-Coding-Agent-Harness\n\nTimestamps:\n00:00:00 Introduction to the live stream and guest Ray.\n00:00:59 Explaining the main topic: Anthropic's harness for long-running agents.\n00:03:32 Ray introduces himself and his AI coding background.\n00:08:13 Explaining the core problem: agents and long context windows.\n00:10:30 Why Cole integrated Linear for task management and observability.\n00:13:42 Discussing Archon, Cole's open-source AI command center.\n00:21:55 Architectural deep dive: How the agent harness works.\n00:25:50 Showing the detailed `app_spec.md` file for building a Claude.ai clone.\n00:30:52 Pro-tip: How to use a Claude Max subscription instead of API credits.\n00:39:20 Showcase: A Claude.ai clone built by the harness in 24 hours.\n00:46:57 Detailing the prompt changes for the Linear integration.\n00:49:02 Ray's 'AGI' moment seeing the fully integrated system.\n00:50:58 Explaining the Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach used.\n01:04:18 Kicking off the live demo.\n01:09:21 Live demo: The initializer agent creates tasks in Linear.\n01:14:35 Live demo: Agent uses Puppeteer to validate the app.\n01:22:30 How to adapt the harness for other models (Codex, OpenCode).\n01:27:36 Live demo: The agent builds the initial UI layout.\n01:34:50 A fun detour into cooking and favorite pizza.\n01:41:09 Will AI stop the creation of new programming languages?\n01:50:08 The importance of automated testing in AI workflows.\n01:56:48 Ray provides a complete summary of the harness architecture.\n01:59:04 Cole discusses his Dynamous community and coding course.\n02:04:50 Final thoughts and wrap-up.\n\nResources:\nAnthropic Engineering Article: https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/effective-harnesses-for-long-running-agents\nClaude Agent SDK Quickstart: https://github.com/anthropics/claude-quickstarts/tree/main/autonomous-coding\nCole's Channel: https://www.youtube.com/@ColeMedin\nDynamis Community: https://dynamous.ai\n\nThe harness and principles here are tool-agnostic.

      "description": "Mark Chen is one of the most influential people in artificial intelligence, and this episode is a rare look inside his world. As the Chief Research Officer at OpenAI, Chen helps decide which ideas get compute, which research threads scale, and how a 500-person lab navigates constant recruiting raids, model races, and the pressure to invent the next paradigm. We talk about the soup-delivering recruiting wars, how OpenAI thinks about staying ahead of Meta and Google, and what it actually feels like to rank 300 internal research projects when everyone believes theirs is the one that matters.\n\nWe also get into Chen’s path from math competitions and high-frequency trading to the early days of OpenAI, and how he ended up helping lead the company through its most chaotic moments. He talks about the breakthrough in reasoning models, the renewed focus on pre-training, the scientific discoveries GPT-5 Pro is already making, and why he thinks fully autonomous AI research is closer than people realize. This is a candid, high-bandwidth conversation with one of the key people shaping the direction of modern AI.\n\nSubscribe to watch more Core Memory videos https://www.youtube.com/@CoreMemoryVideos/videos\n\nCheck out our podcasts https://www.youtube.com/@CoreMemoryPodcast\nhttps://www.corememory.com/podcast\n\nFind Ashlee Vance at \nwww.corememory.com \nhttps://www.instagram.com/ashlee.vance/\nhttps://x.com/ashleevance\n\nChapters \n00:00:00 Intro\n00:05:02 How OpenAI Allocates Compute & Prioritizes Research\n00:08:36 Ignoring Competitors to Find the Next AI Paradigm\n00:14:14 Research vs. Engineering: A False Dichotomy?\n00:16:25 Reacting to Google Gemini 3 & The \"42\" Math Problem\n00:20:07 AI vs. Humans: Competitive Coding & The \"Move 37\" Moment\n00:28:42 Will ChatGPT Replace Technical Interviews?\n00:35:58 Leaving Wall Street High-Frequency Trading for AI\n00:44:26 Joining OpenAI in 2018: Big Vision, Small Team\n00:48:08 Inside the OpenAI \"Coup\": Rallying the Research Team\n00:53:46 Brain Drain: Does Losing Top Researchers Matter?\n01:00:10 Is Scaling Dead?

      "description": "Michael Kratsios is the man of the hour, charged by President Trump to usher in the golden age of AI and American innovation. How is the White House approaching this revolution in technology? What does AI mean for the American worker? How do we stay ahead of China — and also persuade other nations to adopt U.S. tech over Chinese? \n\nWe hosted this conversation at the 2025 Cicero Institute Courage Awards, where we recognize bold policymakers on both sides of the aisle for standing up to special interests and fighting for liberty. Amid the regulatory battle over AI, we were honored to feature Michael, who currently serves as Director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy and a Senior Advisor to President Trump. In the first Trump term, he was the nation's Chief Technology Officer and later acting Under Secretary of War for Research and Engineering. He started his career working for Peter Thiel, first at Clarium Capital and later Thiel Capital. \n\nWe began our conversation with Michael's journey to the White House, and his role leading the White House's science and technology policy agenda. He outlined three key areas to winning the AI race: the right regulatory frameworks, the necessary infrastructure, and international engagement. How do we not only stay ahead of China but also persuade other nations to adopt our AI stack? Michael lays out the strategy. He also makes the case for a federal AI standard and explains why a patchwork of laws stifles innovation, hamstringing the upstarts and entrenching the incumbents. Finally, he lays out what AI will mean for the American worker, and as the man in charge of overseeing AI, quantum, space, and more, he reveals what keeps him up at night. We have a generational opportunity with AI to bring down the cost of living and lift up millions of lives; we're grateful to have leaders like Michael at the helm.",

      "description": "Maor Shlomo is the founder of Base44, an AI-powered app builder that he bootstrapped to an over $80 million acquisition by Wix in just six months. As a solo founder (with severe ADHD), he hit $1 million ARR just three weeks after launch and grew the product to more than 400,000 users, all while navigating two wars in Israel and never raising a dollar of outside funding.\n\n*What you’ll learn:*\n1. The growth playbook that took Base44 from three friends to 400,000 users without spending any money on marketing\n2. How he hasn’t written a single line of front-end code in three months—and how to structure your code repository to make it easier for AI to write your code\n3. His AI productivity stack that allowed him to compete against heavily funded competitors\n4. Why being a solo founder in AI might be the ultimate advantage (and the wedding story that almost killed the business)\n5. The story of signing the $80M acquisition deal while war broke out with Iran\n6. How to identify when to sell vs. stay independent (and why Maor chose acquisition despite being highly profitable)\n7. The counterintuitive product decision that tripled activation by removing a “helpful” feature\n8. How building in public on LinkedIn drove more growth than any paid channel\n\n*Transcript:* https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/the-base44-bootstrapped-startup-success-story-maor-shlomo\n\n*My biggest takeaways (for paid newsletter subscribers):*\nhttps://www.lennysnewsletter.com/i/167384119/my-biggest-takeaways-from-this-conversation\n\n*Brought to you by:*\nSauce—Turn customer pain into product revenue: http://sauce.app/lenny\nDscout—The UX platform to capture insights at every stage: from ideation to production: https://www.dscout.com/\nContentsquare—Create better digital experiences: https://contentsquare.com/lenny/\n\n*Where to find Maor Shlomo:*\n• X: https://x.com/ms_base44\n• LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/maor-shlomo-1088b4144/\n\n*Where to find Lenny:*\n• Newsletter: https://www.lennysnewsletter.com\n• X: https://twitter.com/lennysan\n• LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/lennyrachitsky/\n\n*In this episode, we cover:*\n(00:00) Introduction to Maor and Base44\n(08:16) The origin story: how Base44 came to be\n(14:55) Bootstrapping and solo founding: challenges and insights\n(22:52) Productivity hacks and tech stack for solo founders\n(27:23) How to get started using Base44\n(28:47) Thoughts on raising money\n(34:05) Distribution in the age of AI\n(36:09) Ambition and goals\n(40:05) Growth strategies: from first users to thousands\n(51:32) Building in public\n(57:42) The solo founder journey\n(01:00:23) Community support\n(01:03:23) Hackathons and partnerships\n(01:06:42) The importance of velocity in product development\n(01:08:20) Technical stack and infrastructure insights\n(01:15:24) Activation lessons\n(01:18:19) The acquisition journey with Wix\n(01:25:14) Final thoughts and advice for founders\n\n*Referenced:*\n• Base44: https://base44.com/\n• Retool: https://retool.com/\n• Tzofim: https://www.israelscouts.org/\n• Y Combinator: https://www.ycombinator.com/\n• RescueTime: https://www.rescuetime.com/\n• Cursor: https://www.cursor.com/\n• Wix: https://www.wix.com/\n• The rise of Cursor: The $300M ARR AI tool that engineers can’t stop using | Michael Truell (co-founder and CEO): https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/the-rise-of-cursor-michael-truell\n• Building Lovable: $10M ARR in 60 days with 15 people | Anton Osika (CEO and co-founder): https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/building-lovable-anton-osika\n• Inside Bolt: From near-death to ~$40m ARR in 5 months—one of the fastest-growing products in history | Eric Simons (founder and CEO of StackBlitz): https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/inside-bolt-eric-simons\n• Behind the product: Replit | Amjad Masad (co-founder and CEO): https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/behind-the-product-replit-amjad-masad\n• Everyone’s an engineer now: Inside v0’s mission to create a hundred million builders | Guillermo Rauch (founder and CEO of Vercel, creators of v0 and Next.js): https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/everyones-an-engineer-now-guillermo-rauch\n• Snowflake: https://www.snowflake.com\n• Yoav Orlev on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/yoav-orlev-4a044b72\n• WhatsApp: https://www.whatsapp.com/\n• Amazon: https://www.amazon.com/\n• Google: https://about.google/\n• MongoDB: https://www.mongodb.com/\n• Deloitte: https://www.deloitte.com/\n• Render: Render.com\n• Claude 4: https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-4\n• Gemini: https://gemini.google.com/app\n• Cloudflare: https://www.cloudflare.com/\n\n_Production and marketing by https://penname.co/._\n_For inquiries about sponsoring the podcast, email podcast@lennyrachitsky.com._\n\nLenny may be an investor in the companies discussed.",

      "description": "Nick Turley is Head of ChatGPT, the fastest-growing product in history, with 700 million weekly active users (10% of the world’s population). He was part of the original hackathon team that shipped ChatGPT in just 10 days, helped it grow from zero to billions in revenue, and leads product for what may be the most consequential product of our time. We recorded this the day before GPT-5 launched.\n\n*We discuss:*\n1. The 10-day sprint from deciding to ship ChatGPT to Sam Altman’s tweet (and why it was originally called “Chat with GPT-3.5”)\n2. How they ran a willingness-to-pay Van Westendorp survey in their Discord to decide on the $20/month price point that everyone copied\n3. The “Is it maximally accelerated?” philosophy that drives OpenAI’s insane shipping velocity\n4. Why ChatGPT’s retention curve “smiles”—users leave, then come back months later using it more\n5. The accidental decisions that changed history, including not having a waitlist\n6. The impact ChatGPT will have on SEO and product growth\n7. The counterintuitive reason why shipping unpolished AI features beats waiting for perfection\n8. Why ChatGPT intentionally shipped with that “ugly” model-chooser dropdown\n9.

      "description": "Dr. Fei-Fei Li is known as the “godmother of AI.” She’s been at the center of AI’s biggest breakthroughs for over two decades. She spearheaded ImageNet, the dataset that sparked the deep-learning revolution we’re living right now, served as Google Cloud’s Chief AI Scientist, directed Stanford’s Artificial Intelligence Lab, and co-founded Stanford’s Institute for Human-Centered AI. In this conversation, Fei-Fei shares the rarely told history of how we got here—including the wild fact that just nine years ago, calling yourself an AI company was basically a death sentence.\n\n*We discuss:*\n1. How ImageNet helped spark the AI explosion we’re living through\n2. Why world models and spatial intelligence represent the next frontier in AI, beyond large language models\n3.

Why every company needs an “AI operations lead”\n5. How Dan’s team uses an arsenal of AI agents (Claude, Codex, “Friday,” “Charlie”) in parallel, treating each AI like a specialist with unique strengths\n6. Why generalists will thrive in an AI-first world, as rigid job titles blur and everyone becomes a “manager” of AI tools\n7.

      "description": "Varun Mohan is the co-founder and CEO of Windsurf (formerly Codeium), an AI-powered development environment (IDE) that has been used by over 1 million developers in just four months and has quickly emerged as a leader in transforming how developers build software. Prior to finding success with Windsurf, the company pivoted twice—first from GPU virtualization infrastructure to an IDE plugin, and then to their own standalone IDE.\n\nIn this conversation, you'll learn:\n1. Why Windsurf walked away from a profitable GPU infrastructure business and bet the company on helping engineers code\n2. The surprising UI discovery that tripled adoption rates overnight\n3. The secret behind Windsurf's B2B enterprise plan, and why they invested early in an 80-person sales team despite conventional startup wisdom\n4. How non-technical staff at Windsurf built their own custom tools instead of purchasing SaaS products, saving them over $500k in software costs\n5. Why Varun believes 90% of code will be AI-generated, but engineering jobs will actually increase\n6. How training on millions of incomplete code samples gives Windsurf an edge, and creates a moat long-term\n7.

      "description": "Grant Lee is the co-founder of Gamma, the AI-powered presentation tool that’s one of the hottest and most interesting AI startups in the world right now. They’re valued at over $2 billion, and they hit $100 million ARR in just over two years, with a lean team of just around 30 people. Unlike many fast-growing AI startups, Gamma has been profitable for most of its history, has not raised significant funding, and they built a massive business in a category most investors dismissed. In fact, one investor told Grant his idea was “the dumbest idea he had ever heard.”\n\n*We discuss:*\n1. How Gamma found product-market fit by rethinking their onboarding\n2. Their process for building a “word-of-mouth machine”\n3. How they leveraged more than 1,000 micro-influencers instead of big names\n4. Why focusing on the “first 30 seconds” transformed their business\n5. Their approach to pricing that led to profitability within months\n6.

      "description": "Ethan Smith is the CEO of Graphite—the leading SEO growth agency—and my go-to expert on SEO. After 18 years of mastering traditional SEO, Ethan has been at the forefront of what is called AEO: answer engine optimization, or, more simply, getting your product to show up in ChatGPT/Claude/Gemini/Perplexity answers. He’s discovered that ChatGPT traffic converts six times better than Google search—and most companies are completely missing this opportunity.\n\n*In our conversation, we discuss:*\n1. His 7-step playbook to rank #1 in ChatGPT\n2. Why ChatGPT traffic converts 6x better than Google\n3. How early-stage startups can win at AEO immediately (unlike with SEO, which takes years)\n4. The three tactics that actually work: landing pages, YouTube videos, and Reddit comments\n5. Why help-center content can suddenly be your highest-ROI investment\n6. The specific Reddit strategy that works (spoiler: be authentic)\n7.

      "description": "The Transformer architecture (which powers ChatGPT and nearly all modern AI) might be trapping the industry in a localized rut, preventing us from finding true intelligent reasoning, according to the person who co-invented it. Llion Jones and Luke Darlow, key figures at the research lab Sakana AI, join the show to make this provocative argument, and also introduce new research (CTM) which might lead the way forwards.\n\nWe speak about \"Inventor's Remorse\" & The Trap of Success Despite being one of the original authors of the famous \"Attention Is All You Need\" paper that gave birth to the Transformer, Llion explains why he has largely stopped working on them. He argues that the industry is suffering from \"success capture\"—because Transformers work so well, everyone is focused on making small tweaks to the same architecture rather than discovering the next big leap. \n\n**SPONSOR MESSAGES START**\n—\nBuild your ideas with AI Studio from Google - http://ai.studio/build\n—\nTufa AI Labs is hiring ML Research Engineers https://tufalabs.ai/ \n—\ncyber•Fund https://cyber.fund/?utm_source=mlst is a founder-led investment firm accelerating the cybernetic economy\nHiring a SF VC Principal: https://talent.cyber.fund/companies/cyber-fund-2/jobs/57674170-ai-investment-principal#content?utm_source=mlst\nSubmit investment deck: https://cyber.fund/contact?utm_source=mlst\n—\n**END**\n\nThe \"Spiral\" Problem – Llion uses a striking visual analogy to explain what current AI is missing. If you ask a standard neural network to understand a spiral shape, it solves it by drawing tiny straight lines that just happen to look like a spiral. It \"fakes\" the shape without understanding the concept of spiraling. They argue that today's AI models are similar—they are incredible at mimicking intelligent answers without having an internal process of \"thinking\".\n\nIntroducing the Continuous Thought Machine (CTM) Luke Darlow deep dives into their solution: a biology-inspired model that fundamentally changes how AI processes information.\n\nThe Maze Analogy: Luke explains that standard AI tries to solve a maze by staring at the whole image and guessing the entire path instantly. Their new machine \"walks\" through the maze step-by-step.\nThinking Time: This allows the AI to \"ponder.\" If a problem is hard, the model can naturally spend more time thinking about it before answering, effectively allowing it to correct its own mistakes and backtrack—something current Language Models struggle to do genuinely.\nThe pair discuss the culture of Sakana AI, which is modeled after the early days of Google Brain/DeepMind. Llion nostalgically recalls that the Transformer wasn't born from a corporate mandate, but from random people talking over lunch about interesting problems. \n\nhttps://sakana.ai/\nhttps://x.com/YesThisIsLion\nhttps://x.com/LearningLukeD\n\nTRANSCRIPT:\nhttps://app.rescript.info/public/share/crjzQ-Jo2FQsJc97xsBdfzfOIeMONpg0TFBuCgV2Fu8\n\nTOC:\n00:00:00 - Stepping Back from Transformers\n00:00:43 - Introduction to Continuous Thought Machines (CTM)\n00:01:09 - The Changing Atmosphere of AI Research\n00:04:13 - Sakana’s Philosophy: Research Freedom\n00:07:45 - The Local Minimum of Large Language Models\n00:18:30 - Representation Problems: The Spiral Example\n00:29:12 - Technical Deep Dive: CTM Architecture\n00:36:00 - Adaptive Computation & Maze Solving\n00:47:15 - Model Calibration & Uncertainty\n01:00:43 - Sudoku Bench: Measuring True Reasoning\n\n\nREFS:\nWhy Greatness Cannot be planned [Kenneth Stanley]\nhttps://www.amazon.co.uk/Why-Greatness-Cannot-Planned-Objective/dp/3319155237\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhYGXYeMq_E \n\nThe Hardware Lottery [Sara Hooker]\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/2009.06489\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQFxbQ7ade0 \n\nContinuous Thought Machines [Luke Darlow et al / Sakana]\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05522\nhttps://sakana.ai/ctm/ \nhttps://youtu.be/5X9cjGLggv0 great walkthrough of algo by Yacine Mahdid\n\nLSTM: The Comeback Story?

In this paper, we show for the first time that realistic AI training processes can accidentally produce misaligned models. Specifically, when large language models learn to cheat on software programming tasks, they go on to display other, even more misaligned behaviors as an unintended consequence. These include concerning behaviors like alignment faking and sabotage of AI safety research.\n\n00:00 Introduction\n00:42 What is this work about?\n5:21 How did we run our experiment?\n14:48 Detecting models' misalignment\n22:17 Preventing misalignment from reward hacking\n37:15 Alternative strategies\n42:03 Limitations\n44:25 How has this study changed our views?\n50:31 Takeaways for people interested in conducting AI safety research",

      "description": "We propose a robot agnostic reward function that balances the achievement of a desired end pose with impact minimization and the protection of critical robot parts during reinforcement learning. To make the policy robust to a broad range of initial falling conditions and to enable the specification of an arbitrary and unseen end pose at inference time, we introduce a simulation-based sampling strategy of initial and end poses. Through simulated and real-world experiments, our work demonstrates that even bipedal robots can perform controlled, soft falls.\nPublication link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10635",

Expect prompts, pitfalls, and plenty of chaos as we see if AI can actually replace a developer’s weekend project.\n\nWe’ll also reveal the best workflows, tool stacks, and shortcuts for anyone who wants to build faster—without touching a single line of HTML.\n\n🎙️ New to streaming or looking to level up?

      "description": "We’re introducing SIMA 2, the next major milestone in general and helpful embodied AI agents. 👾\n\nWith Gemini integrated at its core, it moves beyond following basic instructions to think, learn, and collaborate in complex, 3D worlds.\n\n🔵 Advanced reasoning: It can accomplish high-level goals in a wide array of games – describing its intentions, explaining what it sees, and outlining the steps it is taking. \n\n🔵 Improved generalization: It can transfer concepts like “mining” in one game and apply it to “harvesting” in another - connecting the dots between similar tasks. \n\n🔵 Self-improvement: Through trial-and-error and Gemini-based feedback, it can teach itself entirely new skills in unseen worlds without additional human input.\n\n🔵 Adaptability: When tested in simulated 3D worlds created with our Genie 3 world model, it demonstrates unprecedented adaptability by navigating its surroundings, following instructions, and taking meaningful steps towards goals.  \n\nThis research offers a strong path toward applications in robotics and another step towards AGI in the physical world. \n\nLearn more at https://deepmind.google/sima\n___\n\nSubscribe to our channel https://www.youtube.com/@googledeepmind\nFind us on X https://twitter.com/GoogleDeepMind\nFollow us on Instagram https://instagram.com/googledeepmind\nAdd us on Linkedin https://www.linkedin.com/company/deepmind/",

Neither team had any robotics expertise—but we let only one team use Claude.\n\nIn the past, we’ve run simulated studies where Claude trained a robot dog. These helped us assess how Claude might contribute to AI research and development. Project Fetch was us trying something similar in practice.\n\nThis project suggests that we’re not far from a world where frontier AI models can interact with previously-unknown pieces of hardware, even with non-experts at the helm.\n\nFor more, read on: https://www.anthropic.com/research/project-fetch-robot-dog \n\n0:00 Introduction: Why robotics?\n0:30 The experiment\n1:02 Phase 1: Fetch, manually\n1:51 Phase 2: Fetch, programmatically\n5:08 Phase 3: Fetch, autonomously\n6:24 Results",

      "description": "Ding Shum Lecture 3/28/2024\n\nSpeaker: Yann Lecun, New York University & META\nTitle: Objective-Driven AI: Towards AI systems that can learn, remember, reason, and plan\nAbstract: How could machines learn as efficiently as humans and animals?\nHow could machines learn how the world works and acquire common sense?\nHow could machines learn to reason and plan?\nCurrent AI architectures, such as Auto-Regressive Large Language Models fall short. I will propose a modular cognitive architecture that may constitute a path towards answering these questions. The centerpiece of the architecture is a predictive world model that allows the system to predict the consequences of its actions and to plan a sequence of actions that optimize a set of objectives. The objectives include guardrails that guarantee the system's controllability and safety. The world model employs a Hierarchical Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (H-JEPA) trained with self-supervised learning. The JEPA learns abstract representations of the percepts that are simultaneously maximally informative and maximally predictable.

      "description": "In this episode of I’ve Got Questions, I break down the rise in mass layoffs and organizations restructuring. Many headlines claim this is AI starting to take jobs, but that’s not really true. AI is involved in these decisions, just not for the reasons people think. \n\nWhether AI can do your job or not (and it probably can’t) is likely irrelevant to the fate of the job itself.  So I explain what’s actually happening in the workforce today, what we can expect going forward, and what we should be doing right now to stay ahead of it.\n\n0:00 – Why these layoffs are happening\n1:30 – How companies are reallocating capital toward AI\n3:00 – Why organizations are becoming more flexible and startup-like\n6:00 – How “anticipatory restructuring” works\n9:00 – What skills will matter in the AI-first era\n12:00 – Why full-time roles will evolve\n16:00 – Why jobs are going away, but work isn’t\n\nListen to the show on other platforms:\nApple Podcasts – https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/ive-got-questions-with-sinead-bovell/id1841491246\nSpotify – https://open.spotify.com/show/2fwK9NSJGXlFdVkYZ14a8O\n\nFollow my work here:\nWebsite: ⁠https://www.sineadbovell.com⁠\nSubstack: ⁠https://sineadbovell.substack.com⁠\nInstagram: ⁠https://www.instagram.com/sineadbovell⁠\nLinkedIn: ⁠https://www.linkedin.com/in/sineadbovell⁠\nTwitter / X: ⁠https://twitter.com/SineadBovell⁠\nYouTube: ⁠https://www.youtube.com/Sineadbovell⁠\nTikTok: ⁠https://www.tiktok.com/@sineadbovell",

      "description": "Micky and I rank the top vibe coding apps in 2025, from Cursor and Claude Code to Lovable, V0, Bolt, Windsurf, and emerging mobile-focused platforms. They break down which tools work best for technical developers versus non-technical builders, discuss the trust and ecosystem factors that matter when choosing a platform, and share hard-won lessons about the mindset shift required to build software with AI assistance.\n\nTimestamps\n00:00 – Intro\n01:11 – Windsurf\n03:46 – Cursor\n06:33 – Lovable, v0, Bolt\n10:17 – Mobile vibe coding: Rork, VibeCode App, Anything\n15:04 – Codex\n16:52 – Claude Code\n18:28 – Replit\n20:23 – Chef by Convex\n21:39 – Advice for Vibe Coders\n\nKey Points\n\n* Community size and tutorial availability matter as much as technical capability when choosing a vibe coding platform\n* For technical developers, Cursor and Claude Code dominate; for non-technical builders, V0 offers the best balance of power and accessibility\n* Mobile vibe coding platforms (Rourke, Vibe Code App, Anything) represent a new wave of opportunity, especially for consumer apps monetizing through TikTok discovery\n* Non-technical builders need a mindset shift: building real software takes time, testing, and iteration—not five prompts\n* Betting on a platform means betting on the team and founder behind it; follow their vision to choose the right tool\n\nSection Summaries\n\n1) Cursor's Developer-First Dominance\n\nGreg ranks Cursor between A-tier and S-tier, emphasizing that while it requires technical knowledge, its massive community and tutorial ecosystem make it accessible. The Cursor team explicitly builds for developers, not vibe coders, but the tool's popularity has created a React-like network effect. Superior agent architecture—how Cursor's tooling reads, writes, and edits code—gives it an edge even when using the same underlying models as competitors.\n\n2) Lovable, Bolt, v0\n\nBoth Lovable and Bolt land in B-tier for abstracting backend complexity but limiting flexibility. Lovable locks users into Supabase; V0's Vercel marketplace offers more backend options, including Convex. Greg argues V0's template library and tight Vercel integration make it the superior choice for non-technical builders who want prototypes that don't brick after a few prompts.\n\n3) The Mobile Vibe Coding Wave\n\nRourke, Vibe Code App, and Anything represent a new class of platforms targeting mobile app development, likely all built on Expo for cross-platform reach. Micky sees huge opportunity here: consumer apps solving niche problems (like back pain coaching for tall people) can find audiences through TikTok and convert downloads at the moment of pain. These platforms earn B-tier for being early but promising.\n\n4) Codex: Most Improved Model\n\nOpenAI's Codex model earns recognition for rapid improvement, moving from underwhelming to competitive with Claude Sonnet 3.5. While still slightly behind Claude for coding tasks, Codex benefits from OpenAI's resources and a growing non-technical user base via ChatGPT's web interface. Greg places it just below Cursor but above Lovable and Bolt, with optimism about its trajectory.\n\n5) Claude Code's Recent Struggles\n\nClaude Code has been \"nerfed\" recently according to both hosts—what would have been S-tier a month ago now sits below Cursor. The key insight: using the same model (Claude Sonnet 3.5) doesn't guarantee the same output. Agent quality—the tooling layer that lets the model read, write, and edit files—matters enormously. Cursor's agent architecture currently outperforms Claude's own implementation of its model.\n\n6) Mindset Shift for Vibe Coders\n\nMicky's core advice: non-technical people must abandon the expectation that five prompts will produce production-ready software. Building takes planning, testing, alpha and beta phases, and treating code as craft. Tools like Lovable, V0, and Bolt enable creation, but software remains difficult—especially software people pay for. Frustration from broken first attempts is normal; the solution is persistence across multiple tools and iterations, not giving up.\n\nThe #1 tool to find startup ideas/trends - https://www.ideabrowser.com/\n\nLCA helps Fortune 500s and fast-growing startups build their future - from Warner Music to Fortnite to Dropbox.

      "description": "NOETIX Robotics has officially released its humanoid robot \"Bumi,\" targeting the mass consumer market with a price of 9,998 RMB (approximately 1,375 USD). The robot is designed to bring bipedal robotics into households, focusing on education, family interaction, and programming learners.\n\nStanding 94 cm tall and weighing just 12 kg, Bumi achieves stable walking and flexible movements through proprietary algorithms combining imitation and reinforcement learning. The company restructured costs by using composite materials for a lightweight build, a self-developed domain controller, and a highly localized supply chain for scalability.\n\nThe introductory price is 9,998 RMB, with a limited pre-sale scheduled between the \"Singles' Day\" and \"Double Twelve\" shopping festivals via their official WeChat and JD.com channels. NOETIX Robotics (founded September 2023) is leveraging its background in competition-winning robots (N&E series) to drive the practical adoption of humanoid technology.\n\n#noetixrobotics #humanoidrobot #robotics #robot #newrobot",

Technical deep dive into the architecture behind what I've been using.\n\nAfter my post about switching to Droid hit 70K+ views, I wanted to understand the technical \"why.\" So I brought in Luke - he built Goose at Block (used by 5,000 engineers) and now architects Droid's context system. This is me learning the architecture alongside you.\n\nFull transparency: Factory AI is sponsoring this conversation.

With over 70% of developers saying they don't use \"vibe coding\" in their professional work, it's clear there's a lot of skepticism.\n\nIn this video, Pete Johnson, Field CTO of AI at MongoDB, dives headfirst into a real-world vibe coding session to show you what these AI tools are truly capable of. Watch as we use Claude Code to build a complete MEAN (MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node.js) stack application from scratch in under 30 minutes!\n\nWe'll start with the sample \"movies\" database in a free MongoDB Atlas cluster and prompt our AI agents to build a full-featured web app to browse the collection. You'll see the entire process, including:\n\nThe initial prompt and AI-generated project plan.\nHow AI agents write backend and frontend code in parallel.\nThe inevitable bugs and errors that pop up.\nWhy a skilled developer is still essential to guide, debug, and iterate on the AI's output.\n\nThis isn't a perfect, one-shot process. It's a realistic look at how you can leverage generative AI as a powerful pair programmer to accelerate your workflow, not replace it.\n\nCHAPTERS:\n00:00:27 - Introduction\n00:00:54 - The Vibe Coding Debate: What Do Developers Really Think?\n00:01:55 - The Tech Stack: Our AI Vibe Coding Setup Explained\n00:04:27 - A Closer Look: MongoDB Atlas & the MCP Server\n00:06:29 - Configuring Our AI Agents in Claude Code\n00:13:41 - The Master Prompt: Building a MEAN Stack App\n00:15:16 - Let's Go!

      "description": "This episode features Rob Toews from Radical Ventures and Ari Morcos, Head of Research at Datology AI, reacting to Andrej Karpathy's recent statement that AGI is at least a decade away and that current AI capabilities are \"slop.\" The discussion explores whether we're in an AI bubble, with both guests pushing back on overly bearish narratives while acknowledging legitimate concerns about hype and excessive CapEx spending. They debate the sustainability of AI scaling, examining whether continued progress will come from massive compute increases or from efficiency gains through better data quality, architectural innovations, and post-training techniques like reinforcement learning. The conversation also tackles which companies truly need frontier models versus those that can succeed with slightly-behind-the-curve alternatives, the surprisingly static landscape of AI application categories (coding, healthcare, and legal remain dominant), and emerging opportunities from brain-computer interfaces to more efficient scaling methods.\n\n0:00 Intro\n1:04 Debating the AI Bubble\n1:50 Over-Hyping AI: Realities and Misconceptions\n3:21 Enterprise AI and Data Center Investments\n7:46 Consumer Adoption and Monetization Challenges\n8:55 AI in Browsers and the Future of Internet Use\n14:37 Deepfakes and Ethical Concerns\n26:29 AI's Impact on Job Markets and Training\n31:38 Google and Anthropic: Strategic Partnerships\n34:51 OpenAI's Strategic Deals and Future Prospects\n37:12 The Evolution of Vibe Coding\n44:35 AI Outside of San Francisco\n48:09 Data Moats in AI Startups\n50:38 Comparing AI to the Human Brain\n56:07 The Role of Physical Infrastructure in AI\n56:55 The Potential of Chinese AI Models\n1:03:15 Apple's AI Strategy\n1:12:35 The Future of AI Applications\n\nWith your co-hosts: \n@jacobeffron \n- Partner at Redpoint, Former PM Flatiron Health \n@patrickachase \n- Partner at Redpoint, Former ML Engineer LinkedIn \n@ericabrescia \n- Former COO Github, Founder Bitnami (acq’d by VMWare) \n@jordan_segall \n- Partner at Redpoint",

We unpack his viral post (“Failing to Understand the Exponential, again”) and what it looks like when task length doubles every 3–4 months—pointing to AI agents that can work a full day autonomously by 2026 and expert-level breadth by 2027. We talk about the original Move 37 moment and whether today’s AI models can spark alien insights in code, math, and science—including Julian’s timeline for when AI could produce Nobel-level breakthroughs.\n\nWe go deep on the recipe of the moment—pre-training + RL—why it took time to combine them, what “RL from scratch” gets right and wrong, and how implicit world models show up in LLM agents. Julian explains the current rewards frontier (human prefs, rubrics, RLVR, process rewards), what we know about compute & scaling for RL, and why most builders should start with tools + prompts before considering RL-as-a-service. We also cover evals & Goodhart’s law (e.g., GDP-Val vs real usage), the latest in mechanistic interpretability (think “Golden Gate Claude”), and how safety & alignment actually surface in Anthropic’s launch process.\n\nFinally, we zoom out: what 10× knowledge-work productivity could unlock across medicine, energy, and materials, how jobs adapt (complementarity over 1-for-1 replacement), and why the near term is likely a smooth ramp—fast, but not a discontinuity.\n\nJulian Schrittwieser\nBlog - https://www.julian.ac\nX/Twitter - https://x.com/mononofu\nViral post: Failing to Understand the Exponential, Again (9/27/2025)\n\nAnthropic\nWebsite - https://www.anthropic.com\nX/Twitter - https://x.com/anthropicai\n\nMatt Turck (Managing Director)\nBlog - https://www.mattturck.com\nLinkedIn - https://www.linkedin.com/in/turck/\nX/Twitter - https://twitter.com/mattturck\n\nFIRSTMARK\nWebsite - https://firstmark.com\nX/Twitter - https://twitter.com/FirstMarkCap\n\nLISTEN ON:\nSpotify - https://open.spotify.com/show/7yLATDSaFvgJG80ACcRJtq\nApple Podcasts - https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-mad-podcast-with-matt-turck/id1686238724\n\n00:00 Cold open — “We’re not seeing any slowdown.”\n00:32 Intro — who Julian is & what we cover\n01:09 The “exponential” from inside frontier labs\n04:46 2026–2027: agents that work a full day; expert-level breadth\n08:58 Benchmarks vs reality: long-horizon work, GDP-Val, user value\n10:26 Move 37 — what actually happened and why it mattered\n13:55 Novel science: AlphaCode/AlphaTensor → when does AI earn a Nobel?\n16:25 Discontinuity vs smooth progress (and warning signs)\n19:08 Does pre-training + RL get us there?

Sora hype is cooling as TPUs rise—with Jessica noting how The Information's TPU scoop even nudged NVIDIA to move faster. OpenAI’s compute could approach ~$45B/year at ~3 GW, forcing new financing models and tough research vs GTM trade-offs—Sam calls it Pascal’s Wager for Big Tech.

This marks the first time a quantum computer has successfully run a verifiable algorithm that surpasses the ability of classical supercomputers.\n\nIn separate experiments,  we’ve shown we can use Quantum Echoes to characterize the structure of molecules. This capability paves a path for quantum computers to augment traditional Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), offering scientists a powerful new tool to study new kinds of molecular systems. This information is vital for fields like drug discovery and materials science.\n\nAs a result of this breakthrough, we are even more optimistic that we will see real-world applications possible only on quantum computers within five years.\n\nHear directly from Vadim Smelyanskiy, Yu Chen, and Nicholas Rubin from the Google Quantum AI team about this work. \n\nAdditional Resources:\n- Explore the full publication in Nature → http://goo.gle/48Ey6Un\n- Read more on The Keyword → https://goo.gle/4Ou7Rp\n- Get the technical details from the Quantum AI team → http://goo.gle/474hPHa\n\nSubscribe to Google Quantum AI → https://goo.gle/QuantumAI\n\n#GoogleQuantumAI  #QuantumAI",

In this conversation, OpenAI’s VP of Research Jerry Tworek explains how modern reasoning models work in practice—why pretraining and reinforcement learning (RL/RLHF) are both essential, what that on-screen “thinking” actually does, and when extra test-time compute helps (or doesn’t). We trace the evolution from O1 (a tech demo good at puzzles) to O3 (the tool-use shift) to GPT-5 (Jerry calls it “03.1-ish”), and talk through verifiers, reward design, and the real trade-offs behind “auto” reasoning modes.\n\nWe also go inside OpenAI: how research is organized, why collaboration is unusually transparent, and how the company ships fast without losing rigor. Jerry shares the backstory on competitive-programming results like ICPC, what they signal (and what they don’t), and where agents and tool use are genuinely useful today. Finally, we zoom out: could pretraining + RL be the path to AGI? \n\nThis is the MAD Podcast —AI for the 99%. If you’re curious about how these systems actually work (without needing a PhD), this episode is your map to the current AI frontier.\n\n\nOpenAI\nWebsite - https://openai.com\nX/Twitter - https://x.com/OpenAI\n\nJerry Tworek\nLinkedIn - https://www.linkedin.com/in/jerry-tworek-b5b9aa56\nX/Twitter - https://x.com/millionint\n\nFIRSTMARK\nWebsite - https://firstmark.com\nX/Twitter - https://twitter.com/FirstMarkCap\n\nMatt Turck (Managing Director)\nLinkedIn - https://www.linkedin.com/in/turck/\nX/Twitter - https://twitter.com/mattturck\n\nLISTEN ON:\nSpotify - https://open.spotify.com/show/7yLATDSaFvgJG80ACcRJtq\nApple - https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-mad-podcast-with-matt-turck/id1686238724\n\n\n00:00 - Intro\n01:01 - What Reasoning Actually Means in AI\n02:32 - Chain of Thought: Models Thinking in Words\n05:25 - How Models Decide Thinking Time\n07:24 - Evolution from O1 to O3 to GPT-5\n11:00 - Before OpenAI: Growing up in Poland, Dropping out of School, Trading\n20:32 - Working on Robotics and Rubik's Cube Solving\n23:02 - A Day in the Life: Talking to Researchers\n24:06 - How Research Priorities Are Determined\n26:53 - Collaboration vs IP Protection at OpenAI\n29:32 - Shipping Fast While Doing Deep Research\n31:52 - Using OpenAI's Own Tools Daily\n32:43 - Pre-Training Plus RL: The Modern AI Stack\n35:10 - Reinforcement Learning 101: Training Dogs\n40:17 - The Evolution of Deep Reinforcement Learning\n42:09 - When GPT-4 Seemed Underwhelming at First\n45:39 - How RLHF Made GPT-4 Actually Useful\n48:02 - Unsupervised vs Supervised Learning\n49:59 - GRPO and How DeepSeek Accelerated US Research\n53:05 - What It Takes to Scale Reinforcement Learning\n55:36 - Agentic AI and Long-Horizon Thinking\n59:19 - Alignment as an RL Problem\n1:01:11 - Winning ICPC World Finals Without Specific Training\n1:05:53 - Applying RL Beyond Math and Coding\n1:09:15 - The Path from Here to AGI\n1:12:23 - Pure RL vs Language Models",

      "description": "Everyone's talking about the AI datacenter boom right now. Billion dollar deals here, hundred billion dollar deals there. Well, why do data centers matter? It turns out, AI inference (actually calling the AI and running it) is the hidden bottleneck slowing down every AI application you use (and new stuff yet to be released).  \n\nIn this episode, Kwasi Ankomah from SambaNova Systems explains why running AI models efficiently matters more than you think, how their revolutionary chip architecture delivers 700+ tokens per second, and why AI agents are about to make this problem 10x worse.\n\n💡 This episode is sponsored by Gladia's Solaria - the speech-to-text API built for real-world voice AI. With sub-270ms latency, 100+ languages supported, and 94% accuracy even in noisy environments, it's the backbone powering voice agents that actually work.

      "description": "This episode is a little different from our usual fare: It’s a conversation with our head of AI training Alex Duffy about Good Start Labs, a company he incubated inside Every. Today, Good Start Labs is spinning out of Every as a separate company with $3.6 million in funding from General Catalyst, Inovia, Every, and a group of angel investors from top-tier AI labs like DeepMind. We get into how Alex learned some of his biggest lessons about the real world from games, starting with RuneScape, which taught him how markets work and how not to get scammed. He explains why the static benchmarks we use to evaluate LLMs today are breaking down, and how games like Diplomacy offer a richer, more dynamic way to test and train large language models. Finally, Alex shares where he sees the most promise in AI—software, life sciences, and education—and why he believes games can make the models we use smarter, while helping people understand and use AI more effectively.\n\nIf you found this episode interesting, please like, subscribe, comment, and share.\n\nWant even more?\n\nSign up for Every to unlock our ultimate guide to prompting ChatGPT here: https://every.ck.page/ultimate-guide-to-prompting-chatgpt.

I have one \"Intro to LLMs\" video already from ~year ago, but that is just a re-recording of a random talk, so I wanted to loop around and do a lot more comprehensive version.\n\nInstructor\nAndrej was a founding member at OpenAI (2015) and then Sr. Director of AI at Tesla (2017-2022), and is now a founder at Eureka Labs, which is building an AI-native school. His goal in this video is to raise knowledge and understanding of the state of the art in AI, and empower people to effectively use the latest and greatest in their work.\nFind more at https://karpathy.ai/ and https://x.com/karpathy\n\nChapters\n00:00:00 introduction\n00:01:00 pretraining data (internet)\n00:07:47 tokenization\n00:14:27 neural network I/O\n00:20:11 neural network internals\n00:26:01 inference\n00:31:09 GPT-2: training and inference\n00:42:52 Llama 3.1 base model inference\n00:59:23 pretraining to post-training\n01:01:06 post-training data (conversations)\n01:20:32 hallucinations, tool use, knowledge/working memory\n01:41:46 knowledge of self\n01:46:56 models need tokens to think\n02:01:11 tokenization revisited: models struggle with spelling\n02:04:53 jagged intelligence\n02:07:28 supervised finetuning to reinforcement learning\n02:14:42 reinforcement learning\n02:27:47 DeepSeek-R1\n02:42:07 AlphaGo\n02:48:26 reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF)\n03:09:39 preview of things to come\n03:15:15 keeping track of LLMs\n03:18:34 where to find LLMs\n03:21:46 grand summary\n\nLinks\n- ChatGPT https://chatgpt.com/\n- FineWeb (pretraining dataset): https://huggingface.co/spaces/HuggingFaceFW/blogpost-fineweb-v1\n- Tiktokenizer: https://tiktokenizer.vercel.app/\n- Transformer Neural Net 3D visualizer: https://bbycroft.net/llm\n- llm.c Let's Reproduce GPT-2 https://github.com/karpathy/llm.c/discussions/677\n- Llama 3 paper from Meta: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21783\n- Hyperbolic, for inference of base model: https://app.hyperbolic.xyz/\n- InstructGPT paper on SFT: https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.02155\n- HuggingFace inference playground: https://huggingface.co/spaces/huggingface/inference-playground\n- DeepSeek-R1 paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12948\n- TogetherAI Playground for open model inference: https://api.together.xyz/playground\n- AlphaGo paper (PDF): https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10045895/1/agz_unformatted_nature.pdf\n- AlphaGo Move 37 video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT-UZkiOLv8\n- LM Arena for model rankings: https://lmarena.ai/\n- AI News Newsletter: https://buttondown.com/ainews\n- LMStudio for local inference https://lmstudio.ai/\n\n- The visualization UI I was using in the video: https://excalidraw.com/\n- The specific file of Excalidraw we built up: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EZh5hNDzxMMy05uLhVryk061QYQGTxiN/view?usp=sharing\n- Discord channel for Eureka Labs and this video: https://discord.gg/3zy8kqD9Cp\n\nEducational Use Licensing\nThis video is freely available for educational and internal training purposes.

      "description": "The State of AI Report is the most widely read and trusted analysis of key developments in AI. Published annually since 2018, the open-access report aims to spark informed conversation about the state of AI and what it means for the future. Produced by AI investor Nathan Benaich and Air Street Capital.\n\nIn short, it’s been a monumental 12 months for AI. Our eighth annual report is the most comprehensive it’s ever been, covering what you need to know about research, industry, politics, and safety - along with our first State of AI Usage Survey of 1,200 practitioners. The State of AI Report has become the most widely read and trusted report on AI progress and is our open-access contribution to the AI ecosystem.\n\nIn true State of AI Report style, let’s dive into the Research section. 12 months on, OpenAI still leads, but the pack has closed in fast. China’s DeepSeek, Qwen, and Kimi sit within a few points on reasoning and coding. While the US holds the frontier, China is now a credible and popular #2.\n\nOnce a “Llama rip-off,” Qwen now powers 40% of all new fine-tunes on Hugging Face. China’s open-weights ecosystem has overtaken Meta’s, with Llama riding off into the sunset…for now.\n\nReinforcement learning has grown up. After fuzzy human feedback came rubric-based rewards and verifiable reasoning tasks. We’re rediscovering rigor and environments for agents to undertake long-running tasks is all the rage.\n\nWhat’s this approach enabling? OpenAI and Gemini models both hit math Olympiad gold. Open provers like Gödel-LM are publishing formal proofs, showing that AI-assisted theorem proving is no longer science fiction.\n\nBut we’re not just creating superintelligent agents to crush humans. Indeed, AlphaZero-discovered strategies improved the gameplay of four chess Grandmasters, proving that superhuman systems can teach the very best humans, not just beat them.\n\nAI is now a lab partner too. DeepMind’s Co-Scientist and Stanford’s Virtual Lab generate, debate, and validate hypotheses, discover new and established ideas as science is becoming a closed loop with AI in it.\n\nBiology gets its scaling laws too. Profluent’s ProGen3 trained on 1.5T tokens and created a compute frontier for protein language models. This is unlocking generalisation in novel protein space and a path to novel therapeutics such as custom gene editors.\n\nRobots now reason too. “Chain-of-Action” planning brings structured thought to the physical world - from AI2’s Molmo-Act to Gemini Robotics. Massive amounts of effort are thrown into the mix, expect lots of progress here…\n\nAnthropic’s Model Context Protocol is the new USB-C of AI. A single standard to connect models to tools, already embedded in ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, and VS Code, has taken shape. But not without emerging security risks…\n\nNow, onto the Industry section. RIP AGI, long live Superintelligence. AI pilled tech executives have rebranded the mission, and it’s working: provocative, undefined, and exciting.\n\nThe frontier fight is relentless. OpenAI still tops most leaderboards, but DeepMind’s stays there longer. Timing releases have become its own science…not least informing financing rounds like clockwork.\n\nCapability per dollar is doubling every few months. Google’s rate: 3.4 months. OpenAI’s: 5.8 months. More predictable gains are driving more investment, and more intelligence for less money.\n\nAI software adoption has gone mainstream. Ramp data shows 44% of US businesses now pay for AI, up from 5% in 2023. Average contract value for AI products hit $530k in 2025 and is expected to pass $1M in 2026. 12 month retention is now 80%+.\n\nAI-first companies still outrun everyone else too, growing 1.5x faster than peers on Standard Metrics.\n\nDeepSeek’s “$5M training run” deep freak was overblown. Since the market realised the fine print in the R1 paper, that’s led to Jevons paradox on steroids: lower cost per run, more runs, more compute needed, buy more NVIDIA.\n\nEnter Stargate: a $500B, 10GW US mega-cluster (4M chips) backed by Altman, Masa, Ellison, and Trump. The industrial era of AI begins. What a time to be alive.\n\nSovereigns join the race: from China’s $5B Big Fund to the UAE’s MGX, nations are writing cheques to stay in the game. We expect some nations to just tap out and declare neutrality.\n\nChina leads in power infrastructure too, adding over 400GW in 2024 vs 41GW for the US. Compute now clearly runs on geopolitics.\n\nThe AI Safety Institute network has collapsed. Washington ditched attending meetings altogether, while the US and UK rebranded “safety” into “security.”\n\nEurope’s AI Act is wobbling: only 3 states are compliant, leaders calling it “confusing,” and pressure mounting for a pause as it’s clear the continent is being left behind.\n\nChina’s spending through the debt as Xi told ministers to “redouble efforts” on AI, boosting science funding 10% despite record debt.",

      "description": "Project DART: Enabling drones to land in harsh outdoor conditions, including on vehicles at the most extreme speeds. \n\nWe demonstrate a new landing system that lets drones safely land on moving vehicles at speeds up to 110 km/h. By combining lightweight shock absorbers with reverse thrust, our approach drastically expands the landing envelope, making it far more robust to wind, timing, and vehicle motion. This breakthrough opens the door to reliable high-speed drone landings in real-world conditions. This technology was developed at the Createk Design Lab, at the Université de Sherbrooke (Canada). \n\nMore information can be found in this paper:\nIsaac Tunney, John Bass, and Alexis Lussier Desbiens. 2025. “ Friction Shock Absorbers and Reverse Thrust for Fast Multirotor Landing on High-Speed Vehicles.” Journal of Field Robotics. https://doi.org/10.1002/rob.70069\n\nAbstract:\nTypical landing gears of small uninhabited aerial vehicles (UAV) limit their capability to land on vehicles moving at more than 20–50 km/h due to high drag forces, high pitch angles and potentially high relative horizontal velocities. To enable landing at higher speeds, a combination of lightweight friction shock absorbers and reverse thrust was developed. This allows for rapid descents (i.e., 3 m/s) toward the vehicle while leveling at the last instant. Simulations show that the proposed system is (1) more robust at higher descent speeds contrary to traditional configurations, (2) can touchdown at almost any time during the leveling maneuver, thus reducing the timing constraints, and (3) is robust to many environmental, design and operational factors, maintaining a success rate above 80% up to 100 km/h. Compared to standard multirotors, this approach expands the possible state envelope at touchdown by a factor of 60. A total of 38 experimental trials were conducted where a drone successfully landed on a pickup truck moving at speeds ranging from 10 to 110 km/h. The increased touchdown envelope was shown to improve the multirotors' robustness to external disturbances such as winds and wind gusts, sensor errors and unpredictable motion of the ground vehicle. The increased landing capabilities also expand the flight envelope at the start of the leveling maneuver by a factor of 38 compared to a standard multirotor, thereby allowing the drone to fly in tougher conditions and initiate its leveling maneuver from a broader range of altitudes, vertical and horizontal velocities, as well as pitch angles and rates.\n\nOther similar video: https://youtu.be/tG1K_63q00Y\n\nCredits: \nMusic – Dare to Be a Devil – Roof  (Epidemic Sound)",

      "description": "Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at understanding messy, real-world data, but integrating them into production systems remains challenging. Prompts can be unruly to write, vary by model and can be difficult to manage in the large context of a pipeline. In this session, we'll demonstrate incorporating LLMs into a geospatial conflation pipeline, using DSPy. We'll discuss how DSPy works under the covers and highlight the benefits it provides pipeline creators and managers.\n \nTalk By: Drew Breunig, Data Science Leader & Strategist, Overture Maps Foundation  \n \nDatabricks Named a Leader in the 2025 Gartner® Magic Quadrant™ for Data Science and Machine Learning Platforms: https://www.databricks.com/blog/databricks-named-leader-2025-gartner-magic-quadrant-data-science-and-machine-learning \nBuild and deploy quality AI agent systems: https://www.databricks.com/product/artificial-intelligence \nSee all the product announcements from Data + AI Summit: https://www.databricks.com/events/dataaisummit-2025-announcements\n \nConnect with us: Website: https://databricks.com\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/databricks \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/databricks\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/databricksinc\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/databricksinc",

      "description": "I built a small language model in Minecraft using no command blocks or datapacks!\n\nThe model has 5,087,280 parameters, trained in Python on the TinyChat dataset of basic English conversations. It has an embedding dimension of 240, vocabulary of 1920 tokens, and consists of 6 layers. The context window size is 64 tokens, which is enough for (very) short conversations. Most weights were quantized to 8 bits, although the embedding and LayerNorm weights are stored at 18 and 24 bits respectively. The quantized weights are linked below; they are split into hundreds of files corresponding to the separate sections of ROM in the build.\n\nThe build occupies a volume of 1020x260x1656 blocks. Due to its immense size, the Distant Horizons mod was used to capture footage of the whole build; this results in distant redstone components looking strange as they are being rendered at a lower level of detail.\n\nIt can produce a response in about 2 hours when the tick rate is increased using MCHPRS (Minecraft High Performance Redstone Server) to about 40,000x speed.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nWorld download (Vanilla, 1.20.4): https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pf1PtSqCLkHPj-vGpdOxRhDcug8rLIl0/view?usp=sharing\nWorld download (MCHPRS): https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GToQikx1VpJSOg5unnnFhJl8onq0DRhY/view?usp=sharing\nEmulator, weights and guide to running the model: https://github.com/sammyuri/craftgpt\nMCHPRS: https://github.com/MCHPR/MCHPRS\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nMusic: TheFatRat - Fire\nWatch the official music video: https://tinyurl.com/tfrfire\nListen here: https://thefatrat.ffm.to/fire\nFollow TheFatRat: https://ffm.bio/thefatrat\n\nThank you to my sisters, debbieuri and sofiuri, who were there through thick and thin (but mostly thin).",
